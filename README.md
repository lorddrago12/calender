# Calendar GUI (PySimpleGUI)

This project is a simple **calendar-based GUI application** built using **Python and PySimpleGUI**. It allows users to pick a date visually from a calendar and displays the selected date in a formatted way.

This README is written so **you (future you)** and **anyone else reading the project** can quickly understand what this program does and how it works.

## 📌 What This Project Is

A small desktop GUI app that:

* Opens a calendar popup
* Lets the user select a date
* Displays the selected date in an input field
* Shows a confirmation popup with the chosen date

It’s a clean example of using **PySimpleGUI widgets, events, and popups**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

You built this project to:

* Learn PySimpleGUI basics
* Understand GUI layouts
* Work with calendar/date widgets
* Handle user events in a GUI loop

This is a great beginner-friendly GUI utility.

---

## ✨ Features

* System default theme
* Calendar button that opens a date picker
* Manual date popup option
* Date formatting (MM-DD-YYYY)
* User-friendly popups

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* **PySimpleGUI layouts**
* **CalendarButton widget**
* **Popup dialogs**
* **Event loop handling**
* **Input field updates**

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

### GUI Layout

The layout contains:

* An input field to display the selected date
* A button that opens the calendar
* A button that opens a date popup
* An exit button

### Event Loop

The program continuously:

1. Waits for user interaction
2. Detects which button was clicked
3. Opens a calendar popup if needed
4. Updates the input field with the chosen date
5. Displays confirmation messages

This is the standard structure of PySimpleGUI applications.

---

## 🔄 User Flow

1. App window opens
2. User clicks the calendar button
3. User selects a date
4. Date appears in the input box
5. Popup confirms the selection

If no date is selected, the app handles it gracefully.
